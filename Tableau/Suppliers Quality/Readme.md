üîç Suppliers Quality Dashboard: Storytelling with Data to Drive Supplier Performance üìä

I'm excited to share the final project of my internship at DEPI ‚Äî the "Suppliers Quality Dashboard", which I worked on with Belal Hegab. 
This dashboard not only visualizes vendor performance but also tells a compelling story about how we can improve supplier relationships and reduce defects.

üìà Key Features:
<pre>
-Defect Trends: A storytelling approach to visualize trends over time, identifying areas of concern and improvement.
-Vendor Performance: Detailed breakdown across plants and vendors, highlighting where actions are needed.
-Defect Categories: Insight into defect contributions from different categories like logistics, packaging, and mechanicals.
</pre>
This tool brings data to life, helping stakeholders understand where to focus efforts to boost quality and collaboration with suppliers.
