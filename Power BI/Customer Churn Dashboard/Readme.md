🚀 Diving into Customer Churn Insights: My First Dashboard as a DEPI Trainee 🚀

I'm thrilled to share my very first project as a DEPI trainee—a comprehensive Churn Dashboard that I developed to analyse customer behaviour and retention patterns.

📊 Dashboard Overview:
The dashboard provides a detailed analysis of customer churn across various demographics and subscription types. It features insightful visualizations that shed light on factors contributing to churn, including age groups, contract length, payment delays, and spending patterns.

🔍 Key Insights:
- Gender Distribution: The customer base is slightly male-dominant, with 56.77% being male customers.
- Churn Percentage: A significant 56.71% of customers have churned, highlighting an area that needs attention to improve retention strategies.
- Age Groups: Seniors (51+) show a 100% churn rate, while youth (under 30) also have a high churn rate of 55.5%. This calls for targeted interventions to retain customers in these age brackets.
- Contract Length: Monthly contracts exhibit the highest churn rate at 40.2%, followed by quarterly and annual contracts. Understanding the reasons behind this can help in designing better contract offerings.
- Payment Delays: A notable 61.66% of customers experiencing late payment (under 15 days) churn, suggesting a need for improved payment collection processes or flexible payment plans.
- Subscription Type: Churn is relatively even across standard, basic, and premium subscriptions, indicating that churn drivers might be more related to other factors like age or payment habits rather than the subscription type.

💡 Personal Takeaway:
This project has been an invaluable learning experience, and I’m eager to apply these insights to drive data-driven strategies.
