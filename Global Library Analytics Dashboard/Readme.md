📊 Global Library Analytics: A Snapshot of Library Resources Worldwide 🌍📚

I’m excited to share this insightful dashboard that provides a comprehensive look at library resources around the globe! Here are some key takeaways:

<pre>
🌍 Total Librarians: A fascinating look at how librarian distribution varies by country, 
  with concentrations across the US, Europe, and Asia.
📚 Library Expenditures: The US leads in library expenditures, with over $21B, followed by the UK and Canada.
📊 Total Volumes & Libraries: Visual breakdown of how library volumes and libraries are distributed across continents.
📖 User to Library Ratios: Asia and Latin America show interesting dynamics in terms of user engagement with libraries.

Libraries remain essential to knowledge sharing and education globally, and data like this helps drive better resource allocation and understanding.
